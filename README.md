# pwnagotchi-plugin-manager


This will be a repo containing the manager plugin, how it works and what is required to submit your own plugins


This plugin will be the only plugin you need install from a new flash to be able to install new plugins on pwnagotchi.



Plan:

Have versioning, and hashes of previous versions.
Allow direct file uploads
Ownership of plugins.
Possibly either use github as file host, and or opwngrid.
